# Civing

An opinionated, top-down, UI layer for CiviCRM built with Angular.

The current UI is a bazaar of competing design ideas and approaches and the time and effort required to improve it tends to infinity.

Style guides and similar have been designed and partially implemented but the effort taken to implement them, and the ease with which they can be flouted has prevented them from becoming universally adopted. Civing is an attempt to wipe the slate - to construct a new UI that does the hard work for you, and cannot be abused.

Civing defines the entire set of UI elements that you can choose from. You cannot create your own elements for specific pages. New design ideas and approaches are welcome but these should be discussed and approved globally, and thus rolled out for the entire system.
